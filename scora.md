The Zimbabwe Medical Student’s Association,(ZiMSA) Standing Committee on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights including HIV and AIDS (SCORA) is a gathering of passionate individuals who are committed to promote sexual and
reproductive health and rights and are arduous about creating positive change in their local communities.

SCORA focuses on issues related to reproductive health, HIV\AIDS, sexually transmitted infections(STIs), gender equality, maternal health, and gender-based violence.


SCORA gathers passionate individuals who are committed to promoting sexual and reproductive health in their community and fight for individual’s rights to information and education. 

SCORA members are incorrigible optimists who, with their positive energy, try to break down all the obstacles and taboo
topics of this society. 

SCORA’s vision is that every
person should be equally aware of their sexual and reproductive health, in a world without stigma and
discrimination.
