  Hey, Iâ€™m Shekinah. I am a med student, and I love cooking and baking. I run a
  cool standing committee, the standing committee on Medical Education, SCOME.
  We love spreading awareness (to medical personnel and the general public)
  about all things medicine; from pathology, diagnosis to management. And we
  love checking up on the med studentsâ€¦ just making sure that school is not
  drowning them. 

  Basically, as long as youâ€™re a Scomedian, you will never walk alone in med schoolðŸ–¤
