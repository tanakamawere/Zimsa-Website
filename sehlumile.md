Sehlumile is a comprehensive program designed to combat period poverty by distribution of reusable pads to underprivileged girls in Zimbabwe. 

The initiative exists under the governance of the Zimbabwe Medical Students Association. Established in 2021, The reusable pads are manufactured using environmentally friendly materials and specifically designed to be long lasting and comfortable and easy to maintain. Through this initiative we aim to guarantee a cost effective and sustainable solution.

In collaboration with our partners, Sehlumile is working tirelessly to provide fundamental menstrual education to young girls in Zimbabwe. Additionally, we strive to end period poverty by increasing availability and accessibility of reusable sanitary wear to young girls. We aim to see a reduction in the number of girls resorting to unhygienic practices. Contribution to multiple Sustainable Development Goals is a major objective for our project as we facilitate good health and well being, along with quality education and gender equality.
