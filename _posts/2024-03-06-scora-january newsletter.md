In Zimbabwe, several
marginalized groups face unique challenges and barriers when it comes to accessing SRH
services. Women and girls in Zimbabwe face various challenges in accessing SRH services due
to socio-cultural norms, gender inequalities, and limited resources. They often encounter
barriers such as lack of information, limited decision-making power, and financial constraints.
Additionally, cultural taboos and stigma surrounding topics such as contraception, abortion,
and sexual health can prevent them from seeking and receiving appropriate care.
The experiences of marginalized groups in
accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health services.
Big thanks to Blessing Mushango (Part 2 MSU) for taking the initiative to spread
cervical cancer awareness in his local chapter and mobilizing participants from MSU
for the poster challenge. The challenge was a success, with many students
participating and sharing our message with their family and friends. With more
people becoming aware of the importance of cervical cancer prevention and
treatment, we hope to see a decline in the number of people affected by this
disease.

Adolescents in Zimbabwe face specific barriers to accessing SRH services. Limited access to comprehensive
sex education in schools and societal taboos surrounding adolescent sexuality contribute to a lack of
knowledge and awareness about SRH services. Additionally, legal restrictions on accessing services without
parental consent can deter adolescents from seeking care, particularly for sensitive issues such as
contraceptives or sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Another marginalized group are the LGBTQ+
individuals in Zimbabwe who often face discrimination, violence, and stigma, which can significantly impact
their ability to access SRH services. Homophobic attitudes within society and healthcare settings may lead
to denial of care or mistreatment. Fear of discrimination and exposure also discourage LGBTQ+ individuals
from seeking SRH services, including HIV testing, counseling, and treatment.
People living with HIV/AIDS may face discrimination and stigma, which can hinder their access to SRH
services. Fear of disclosure and subsequent discrimination can prevent individuals from seeking HIV testing,
treatment, and counseling. Additionally, limited availability of specialized services and medications can pose
challenges for individuals in remote or underserved areas. Moreover, access to SRH services in rural and
remote areas of Zimbabwe is often limited. These areas face challenges such as long distances to healthcare
facilities, inadequate infrastructure, and shortages of healthcare professionals and supplies. Limited
transportation options and financial constraints may further hinder marginalized groups from accessing
necessary SRH services.
To address these challenges and improve access to SRH services for marginalized groups, several strategies
can be implemented. Implementing comprehensive sex education programs in schools to provide accurate
information about SRH, contraceptives, and STIs, promoting healthy relationships, and empowering young
people to make informed decisions. Conducting targeted outreach campaigns to raise awareness about SRH
services, debunking myths and reducing stigma. Engaging community leaders, civil society organizations, and
local influencers to promote inclusivity and acceptance of marginalized groups. Providing specialized training
to healthcare providers on providing non-discriminatory, and culturally sensitive care. This training should
focus on addressing biases, improving communication skills, and creating safe spaces for all individuals
seeking SRH services. Increasing the availability and accessibility of SRH services in rural and remote areas
through mobile clinics, outreach programs, and telemedicine initiatives. Strengthening the supply chain
management to ensure a consistent stock of essential medications and supplies. Advocating for legal
reforms that protect the rights of marginalized groups. Efforts to address these challenges require
collaboration between the government, civil society organizations, healthcare providers, and community
members. By prioritizing inclusivity, awareness, and targeted interventions, Zimbabwe can work towards
ensuring that marginalized groups have equal access to SRH services, promoting their overall health and
well-being.
